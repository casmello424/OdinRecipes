        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            Steak is a cut of meat, most commonly beef, that is typically sliced perpendicular
            to the muscle fibers.

        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless ribeye steaks</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2-4 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary<em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed<em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the steaks:</strong>Remove steaks from refrigerator 20-30 minutes before
            cooking to bring them close to room temperature. Pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong>Preheat your oven to 400 °F. Rub both sides of each
            steak with the olive oil, then season generously with salt and pepper. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sear:</strong>Heat a cast iron or other oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat 
             until it is very hot. Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan. Sear for 1-2 minutes on the first sides
            until a brown crust forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip and Finish:</strong>Flip the steak and sear the second side for another 1-2 minutes
        . Remove the skillet from the stovetop. Top each steak with 1 tablespoon of butter and add thyme/rosemary
        and garlic cloves to the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Immediately transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes,
        depending on the thickness of your steak and desired doneness.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Remove the
        steaks from the pan and let them rest on a plate for 5-10 minutes before slicing to lock in the juices.</li>

        </ol>

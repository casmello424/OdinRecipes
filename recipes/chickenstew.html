        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1.5 Ibs boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>3 celery stalks, sliced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 Ib potatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried italian seasoning<em>(or a mix of dried thyme and rosemary)</em></li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsely, chopped for garnish<em>(optional)</em></li>




        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the chicken:</strong>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
            Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper then add them to the pot and cook lightly until browned on all sides.
            Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate. </li>
            <li><strong>Saute the vegetables:</strong>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrots, and celery to the same pot.
            Cook, stirring occassionally, for 5-7 minutes until the onions have softened and the bottom of the pot has developed some browned bits.</li>
            <li><strong>Add garlic and flour:</strong>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Sprinkle the flour over the 
            vegetables and stir well to coat everything, cooking for another minute to cook off the raw flour taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Add liquid and simmer:</strong>Slowly pour in the chicken broth while stirring continuously to prevent lumps.
            Add potatoes and dried herbs, and return the browned chicken to the pot.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the stew:</strong>Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot partially with a lid, and simmer
            for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong>Taste the stew and add more salt and pepper if needed. Dischard any large herb stems or bay leaves if used. 
            Garnish with fresh parselyand serve warm, ideally with crusty bread for dipping.</li>
